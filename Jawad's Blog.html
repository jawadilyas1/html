	The 3-D glasses have polarizing filters matching to the projectors' filters. Your brain merges the images to see depth.
	 But tilting your head puts the filter at the wrong angle — each eye may start seeing a weak version of the other's image.
	 Circular polarization avoids this problem.
	</p>
	<p>
	We see the world from two, shifted views, one provided by each eye. Hold a finger in front of your face while covering one eye at a time — the position of your finger jumps. Your brain uses the offset in those views to determine an object’s distance, triangulating between both eyes. Scientists think that computation occurs in the visual cortex, where individual brain cells seem sensitive to specific distances between the eyes and use those distances to compute depth.

	The glasses recreate that triangulation by feeding distinct images to the eyes.
	 They approximate the offsets, depending on how far things are, that your eyes expect in life. Look at a movie character without the glasses — two outlines extend from the character, identical except one’s blue, the other red, and they’re slightly offset. With the glasses back on, your brain merges those images to create the perception of depth. The lenses control what each eye sees by filtering the light going to each eye, only letting certain wavelengths pass.

	This is how a scene might look if you took off your glasses during a 3D movie. Two outlines extend from the cacti, identical except one’s blue, the other red, and they’re slightly offset.

	Filmmakers consider how the degree of offset between these images translates to depth inside our brains.

	Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do.
	 Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites.

	Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer.
	 When children learn to code, it helps them to develop essential skills such as problem solving, logic and critical thinking.
	 Through coding, children can learn that there’s often more than one way to solve a problem, and that simpler and more efficient solutions are often better.
	 Learning to code encourages children to become creators, not just consumers, of the technology they use.

	A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.
	[1] Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone conference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference.
	 One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as "an act or process of coming together" - for example "as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]".[2]

	Meeting planners and other meeting professionals may use the term "meeting" to denote an event booked at a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.[1][3]

	Anthropologist Helen B. Schwartzman defines a meeting as "a communicative event involving three or more people who agree to assemble for a purpose ostensibly related to the functioning of an organization or group."[4] For her, meetings are characterized by "multiparty talk that is episodic in nature, and participants either develop or use specific conventions for regulating this talk."[4]

	Without hard work, there is no success in life. An idle person, who is seen relaxing all the time, can never achieve success.
 	It is impossible to reach the height of success without hard work.
	 People always think of shortcuts, but there is no shortcut in life.

	You can video call people using this phone, and also manage your official documents. You get the chance to use social media and play music through it. Moreover, we see how mobile phones have replaced computers and laptops. We carry out all the tasks through mobile phones which we initially did use our computer
